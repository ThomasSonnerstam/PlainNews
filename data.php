        "content" => "An aircraft skidded off the runway at Mumbai airport when it landed in heavy rains.

        SpiceJet flight SG6237, which was flying from Jaipur in Rajasthan, overran the runway upon landing at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj airport. 
        
        From images shared on social media, it appears the Boeing 737-800 jet slid through mud before coming to a stop off the side of the main runway at India’s second-largest airport.
        
        Images show the aircraft nose resting on the ground.
        
        It's thought that the airport is still working on extricating the aircraft. ",
