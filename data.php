                From images shared on social media, it appears the Boeing 737-800 jet slid through mud before coming to a stop off the side of the main runway at India’s second-largest airport.\n
                Images show the aircraft nose resting on the ground.\n
                It's thought that the airport is still working on extricating the aircraft. ",

                The 92kg craft cost him a total of Rs50,000 (£270) to make and he claims it can fly to 1,000 feet.\n
                Mr Fayaz told reporters he had been told to contact Pakistan’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to gain permission for his test flight, but he did not do so.\n
                “Owing to my limited resources, I was unable to contact the civil aviation officials and finally decided to take test flights without getting permission,” he told Pakistan’s Dawn.com.",
