My first PHP assignment during my web developer programme at Yrgo, Gothenburg.

## BUILT WITH:

- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Love and nurture



## **INSTALLATION**

- Download the latest version of PHP.
- Clone this repository with GitHub Desktop, your terminal, or anyway you can.
- Open the folder in your code editor of choice.
- Open your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository directory.
- Open a local hosted server by typing ```php -S localhost:XXXX``` (replace XXXX by any digits).
- Now you can navigate to your browser and type in ```localhost:XXXX``` and replace the X's with the digits you chose.
<br>
Now you're able to look at the website.


## **CODE REVIEW**

- functions.php - you should add PHP DocBlocker to each function. To use it, type /** on the line above the function.
- README.md - you could add screenshots of desktop and mobile to give a preview of the site.
- README.md - you could also get rid of the gif in the README to make the project look more serious.
- Since you are using camelcase in both JavaScript and in PHP, it would look better if you'd use it for CSS as well instead of using kebabcase
- On lines 59, 60 & 152, 153 & 199, 200 & 245, 246 & 291, 292 & 337, 338 you could shorten all these into one line by using "margin: X X X X"
