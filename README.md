# **PLAINNEWS**

My first PHP assignment during my web developer programme at Yrgo, Gothenburg.



## **HOW TO USE**

- Download the latest version of PHP.
- Clone this repository with GitHub Desktop, your terminal, <br> or anyway you can.
- Open the folder in your code editor of choice.
- Open your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository directory.
- Open a local hosted server by typing > php -S localhost:XXXX <br> (replace XXXX by any digits).
- Now you can navigate to your browser and type in >localhost:XXXX and replace the X's with the digits you chose. 
<br>
Now you're able to look at the website.
